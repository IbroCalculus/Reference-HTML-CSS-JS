/*
  Search dependencies from npmjs.com

Within the project's directory terminal, know the package/dependency name and use command:
npm install uuid (Where uuid is the particular package we want to install)
See the package within package.json, ie: 
  "dependencies": {
    "uuid": "^9.0.1"
  }

  --- To use installed dependencies ---
   Within project's app.js:
   const uuid = require('uuid');
