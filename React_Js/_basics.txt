It uses components.

    ======== Project Structure/Folders =====

- node_modules: Contains external libraries/packages that the project depends on.
- public: Contains public assets, ie fonts, videos, images etc. which are NOT bundled with the app during final output.
- src: The main source of the project
- src: -> assets: Similar to public, but files within are bundled during final output.
       -> main.jsx:   This acts as the main jsx file
       -> index.html: This acts as the index.html file, entry point of the app.
       -> index.css:
       -> App.jsx:
       -> App.css: 
- package.json: Contains project's meta data


    ================== Working a project ==================
    We work mainly by editing the App.jsx component. We create and add new components to it, and it is in turn called in main.jsx

    --- Basic structure of App.jsx:    
      function App() {

        return (
          <>
          </>
        )
      }
      export default App

      We add other components to the App.jsx component

    -------- Creating and Adding New components to App.jsx-------------
    --- 1. ie Header.jsx ----    
    function Header() {
        return (
            <>
            <header>
                <h1>My Website</h1>
            </header>

            </>
        );
    }
    export default Header;

  --- 2. ie Footer.jsx ----
    function Footer(){
        return (
            <>
            <h1>This is a footer</h1>
            </>
        );
    }
    export default Footer;


    --- In App.jsx ---    
    import Header from "./Header"
    import Footer from "./Footer"

    function App() {

      return (
        <>
        <h1>Welcome to thi</h1>
        <Header />
        <Header></Header>
        <Footer />  
        </>
      )
    }
    export default App
